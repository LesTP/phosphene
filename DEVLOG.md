# Phosphene — Development Log

<!-- Chronological record of what happened during development.
     Each step gets a structured entry. This is the audit trail.

     Archival rule: When this file exceeds ~500 lines, move completed
     module entries to DEVLOG_archive.md during phase completion cleanup.

## Module 1: Memory Store

### Step 1: Project bootstrap, types, and errors

Mode: Build
Outcome: Complete
Contract changes: None

Created the Python package skeleton for `phosphene.memory_store`, including `pyproject.toml`, the public package exports, the Memory Store dataclasses, and the exception hierarchy required by `ARCH_memory_store.md`. Added focused tests for dataclass defaults and construction, full `NoteInput` optional-field acceptance, and exception construction/catching through `MemoryStoreError`.

The step introduced no contract changes. Verification passed for the targeted tests under the available Python 3.11 interpreter because Python 3.12 is not installed in this container.
