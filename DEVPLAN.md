# Phosphene — Development Plan

<!-- This file is the primary state document for autonomous iteration.
     Workers read it on every cold start to determine what to do next.
     Keep it concise — the DEVPLAN should get SHORTER as work progresses. -->

## Cold Start Summary

<!-- Stable section — update on major shifts, not every step. -->

- **What this is** — Autonomous personality agent with hierarchical memory, attention filtering, and personality development through distillation.
- **Key constraints** — Python 3.12+. Depends on toolkit/ (sibling project, all modules complete). Obsidian-compatible markdown storage. LLM API costs managed via subscription rotation and model tier system. Runs on Raspberry Pi 5 (orchestration only, inference via API).
- **Gotchas** —
  - toolkit/ is an external dependency — import from it, never modify it
  - Memory Store uses consumer-provided embeddings (no toolkit/embedding dependency in the store itself)
  - All 9 ARCH files define contracts — implementation must match signatures exactly
  - Model selection policy D-5: single primary model during establishment phase (~90 days)
  - NTFS drives: use `bash script.sh`, not `./script.sh`
  - **Test environment** — system Python is 3.11.2 with no pytest; `pip install --user` is blocked (externally-managed-environment); `python3 -m venv .venv` creates binaries that can't run on this NTFS-3G mount (no exec bits, can't chmod). Working pattern: `pip install --target .python_deps` (already pre-installed in repo root) and run with `PYTHONPATH=src:.python_deps python3 -m pytest tests/memory_store`. Do NOT recreate `.venv` or reinstall — `.python_deps/` is gitignored and persists.

## Current Status

- **Phase** — Module 3 Phase 1: Source Ingestion contract and adapter foundation
- **Focus** — Step 3.1.4: shared content normalization helpers
- **Blocked/Broken** — None

## Module 1: Memory Store (complete)

Four-phase plan (matching ARCH_memory_store.md public API surface) — all phases complete.

- **Phase 1 (complete)** — Core data model and CRUD: types, errors, vault I/O, store/get/update for individual notes. See DEVLOG "Phase 1 Completion" entry.
- **Phase 2 (complete)** — Index layer and queries: `get_index`, `query_notes`, inbound link counting, and index-backed `get_note` / `update_note`. See DEVLOG "Phase 2 Completion" entry.
- **Phase 3 (complete)** — Embedding search and graph operations: `search_by_embedding`, `add_links`, `get_linked`, `get_personality_context`, plus sidecar embedding persistence on read paths. See DEVLOG "Phase 3 Completion" entry.
- **Phase 4 (complete)** — Decay, supersession, and density metrics: `supersede`, `run_decay`, `get_density_metrics`. See DEVLOG "Phase 4 Completion" entry.

## Module 2: Attention Filter (complete)

Planned phases follow `ARCH_attention_filter.md`: first stabilize the public contract (including `ScoringConfig`) and deterministic geometric scoring helpers, then add Memory Store retrieval/embedding integration, then LLM Phase 1 scoring (precision_surplus) and assertion extraction (friction), then full batch orchestration with triple-gate blend.

### Phase 1 (audited complete): Attention Filter contract and scoring foundation

Delivered ARCH-aligned public dataclasses/exports, default precision-surplus criteria, config validation, triple-gate blend helpers, deterministic Phase 2 geometric scoring helpers, and focused tests. Audited complete. See DEVLOG "Phase 2.1 Completion" and "Phase 2.1 Audit Closure" entries.

### Phase 2 (reviewed complete): Memory Store retrieval and embedding integration

Delivered embedding boundary integration, Memory Store density reads, similar-note retrieval contexts, Memory Store-backed structural preparation, and non-LLM public-path wiring without Memory Store writes or premature LLM/annotation behavior. Reviewed complete. See DEVLOG "Phase 2.2 Completion" and "Phase 2.2 Audit Closure".

### Phase 3 (complete): LLM Phase 1 scoring and assertion extraction

Delivered private LLM prompt scoring, precision-surplus composite integration, incoming assertion extraction, friction-preparation records, and public-path regression coverage while preserving the no-accepted-fragments boundary before orchestration. Reviewed and completed. See DEVLOG "Phase 2.3 Review" and "Phase 2.3 Completion" entries.

### Phase 4 (complete): Full batch orchestration and annotation output

Delivered annotation generation, acceptance and auto-accept decisions, public `AnnotatedFragment` assembly, rejected counts, batch metadata, and Phase 2 assertion-extraction gating while preserving read-only Memory Store behavior. Reviewed and completed. See DEVLOG "Phase 2.4 Review" and "Phase 2.4 Completion" entries.

## Module 3: Source Ingestion (in progress)

Planned phases follow `ARCH_source_ingestion.md`: first stabilize the public contract, manager orchestration, adapter registry boundary, shared content normalization, and state-marker abstraction without live network adapters; then add concrete autonomous adapters, human-share handling, corpus import adapters, and persistence/integration hardening.

### Phase 1 (active): Source Ingestion contract and adapter foundation

Build the `phosphene.source_ingestion` package foundation as a leaf module with ARCH-aligned dataclasses, errors, validation, manager polling behavior, adapter registration, deterministic link/content normalization helpers, and focused unit coverage. Do not implement live Telegram/RSS/Reddit HTTP/API fetching or corpus archive parsing in this phase.

- [x] **Step 3.1.1** — Add the public package scaffold: ARCH-defined dataclasses, errors, package exports, and constructor-compatible `SourceIngestion` stub.
- [x] **Step 3.1.2** — Add config validation and adapter lookup semantics, including unknown adapter types, duplicate labels, missing required params/credentials, enabled filtering, and `AdapterNotFoundError`.
- [x] **Step 3.1.3** — Implement the internal adapter protocol/registry and manager polling orchestration with deterministic fake adapters for tests, per-adapter `IngestionResult` assembly, and per-item error capture.
- [ ] **Step 3.1.4** — Add shared normalization helpers for URL extraction, content truncation, timestamp preservation, and `ContentItem` assembly without network fetching.
- [ ] **Step 3.1.5** — Add focused Source Ingestion unit tests covering public exports, config defaults, manager behavior, adapter errors, normalization helpers, and empty/no-enabled-adapter polling.
